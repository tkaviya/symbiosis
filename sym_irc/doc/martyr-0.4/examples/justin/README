Compiling:
  Justin will pull its libs from martyr's lib dir.  Must build martyr
  first, or have martyr.jar file in the martyr base dir.

  ant clean main 

  For more information on using Ant, see the build.xml file.

Running:
  ant run

or the usual, put martyr.jar & justin.jar in your classpath and
execute dammfine.justin.Justin <server> <channel>

Note: unix users, don't forget that # is a comment symbol in many
shells, so 'wrap' your channel name.

You can get ant from:
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/
