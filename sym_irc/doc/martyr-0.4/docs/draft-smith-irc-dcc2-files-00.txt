Abstract

   The Direct Client Connection v2 (DCC2) specification describes how to
   create file transfers between individual IRC clients.  This draft
   describes two direct client connection file transfer protocols, a
   singe file transfer protocol with file details exchanged over IRC and
   an advanced multi-file protocol with file details exchanged over a
   direct client connection.

1.  Introduction

1.1  Background

   The Direct Client Connection 2.0 (DCC2) is a specification currently
   under development by the <http://www.dcc2.org/>.

   DCC2 creates a framework for standardized connection negotiation
   between IRC clients. DCC2's design allows clients to automatically
   negotiate acceptable connection parameters, and makes it possible for
   users' clients to review the parameters and automate decision-making
   in the connection negotiation process.

   For more information on the DCC2 specification please consult the
   <http://www.dcc2.org/>.

1.2  Motivation

   The current DCC protocol does not address IPv4 vs. IPv6 issues, SSL/
   TLS encryption negotiation, NAT and Firewall traversal, and multiple
   file/directory file transfers.  DCC file transfers are also flawed in
   requiring acknowledgement of received bytes during the transfer,
   something that the underlying TCP protocol already ensures.  Many IRC
   clients have implemented extensions that try to solve these problems,
   but the result has been fragmentation of the DCC protocol.  This
   fragmentation is to a point where only the most simple functions work
   between different clients.

   DCC2 has been introduced to solve these problems and insure
   interoperability between all IRC clients.  The DCC2 negotiation
   system has also been designed to be extensible to incorporate future
   technological developments more easily that the original IRCII DCC
   implementation.

1.3  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2.  DCC2 Overview

   DCC2 allows IRC clients to negotiate connection settings using a
   handshake mechanism for agreement to protocol usage.  Protocols
   available on the offering client are published to the receiving
   client.  The receiving client can then reply to the offering client,
   listing the subset of the available protocols that must be used.  The
   receiving client also has the option to open the connection if the
   offering client cannot accept incoming connections.

   The available protocols and options are presented as a list of space
   separated tokens or token=value pairs.  These tokens are standardized
   and listed here.  Additional tokens can be added through the DCC2.org
   community process.

3.  File Transfers

3.1  Single File

   Single file transfers are initiated over IRC using the DCC2
   negotiation protocol.  File name, size, and an optional offset are
   exchanged via IRC messages.  This exchange is covered in the DCC2
   negotiation documentation.

   After a TCP connection has been established, the offering client
   sends all the bytes of the file to the receiving client.  The
   receiving client reads bytes from the connection until SIZE bytes
   have been read.  In the case of an offset, the client will read
   SIZE-OFFSET bytes.  When all bytes have been transferred, the
   receiving client must close the connection.

3.2  Multi File Transfers

3.2.1  Motivation

   With a file transfer established outside of IRC, it is possible to
   send multiple files and directories since message length is not
   restricted. This is useful for sending multiple files without
   possibly being kicked off an IRC server for flooding, or for sending
   documents in a directory structure.  With additional file metadata,
   file hashes can optionally be obtained and checked.  Privacy is also
   increased since file name and size information can be transferred
   directly between clients without revealing information to a IRC
   server.  For added privacy, file transfers can optionally be
   encrypted.

3.2.2  Method

   After a TCP connection has been established, the offering client
   sends all the bytes of the Multi File header description to the
   receiving client.  The receiving client reads the header description
   and sends requests for files over the connection using an identifier,
   or an identifier and an offset.  The offering client sends the bytes
   of the requested files in the order the requests arrived.  When the
   receiving client has received a the files that it wants from the
   published files list, the receiving client sends a complete message
   and closes the connection.

3.2.3  Multi Send Syntax

   The DCC2 MULTI protocol allows the receiving client to request a file
   from a published set, resuming of a file in a published set, and the
   ability to end a session.  Only the receiving client may send any

   commands over the connection.  All messages end with the newline
   character.  The offering client must not send any command syntax.
   The syntax follows, specified using ABNF rules (as per RFC2234 [3]):

   dcc2-multi = dcc2-multireq | dcc2-multiend LF

   dcc2-multireq       = `SEND FILE=' 1*(alpha|digit) [ space 'OFFSET=' 1*digit ]

   dcc2-multiend = 'COMPLETE'

   Example Receiving client commands

   SEND FILE=0
   SEND FILE=1 OFFSET=3429342
   SEND FILE=2
   COMPLETE


3.2.4  Multi Header

3.2.4.1  Description

   The header defines all files that are present in a file transfer.
   Each file consists of a series of name:value pairs of metadata.  Each
   file section is seperated by a double newline.  The syntax follows,
   specified using ABNF rules (as per RFC2234 [3]):

   multi = file-section 0*(LF LF file-section)

   file-section = header-section 0*(header-section)

   header-section = 1*(alpha | digit | '-') ':' SPACE header-value LF

   header-value = 1*(%x01-09 | %x0B-7F)


3.2.4.2  Required Header Fields

3.2.4.2.1  id

   A unique value in this header, used to request a file.

3.2.4.2.2  name

   A file name, or a relative path and file name.

3.2.4.3  Optional Header Fields

4.  Security Considerations

   Ports under 1024 are privileged on most systems, and should not be
   used for direct client connections.

   IRC client writers should be careful with directory structures when
   dealing with file sharing operations.  Relative paths can using ../
   can lead to security risks

   IRC clients should look carefully at the speed of sending DCC2
   REFUSED and DCC2 CANNOTACCEPT due to the potential for flooding
   attacks.  When possible the messages should be sent to give the user
   context as to why the transfer failed
