Of course, you should be an experienced Java developer, since Martyr
isn't a program, it is a framework.

To compile martyr under Linux, just go

ant

In the martyr root directory.  Hopefully a martyr.jar will pop out.

If not, check build.xml file.  You might try changing the
"build.compiler" option.  Delete it to get the default javac compiler.
You might need to include your tools.jar file (distributed with the
JDK) in your classpath.


You can also compile documentation:

ant javadocs

Under other platforms I do not know what the proper command is to
compile martyr.  Ant, the build system used, is fully cross platform,
so it should just be a matter of figuring out how to run Ant.
