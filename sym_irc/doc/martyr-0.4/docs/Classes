This file lists important classes and how they interact.

User names or nicks should be represented with one of two classes:

util.FullNick - represents a nickname (sork) or a full name
(sork!sork@f00f.net).  It has an 'equals' method which compares the
nick portion of the full name only.  This is so that (new
FullNick("sork")).equals( new FullNick("sork!sork@f00f.net"))
evaluates to true.

util.Member - represents a user on a channel.  The same user will have
seperate entries for each channel they are on.  This records the nick
(a FullNick) without any @ or + symbol, and the mode of the user.
From the mode we can determine if they are an op, have voice, or
whatever.
