Why Martyr?

The name 'jirc' (pronounced jerk) was suggested, and I quite liked
that name, but it was taken by a Perl IRC Bot.

A search of the patron saint list found St. Justin Martyr, patron
saint of speakers.  It is also appropriate because the IRC protocol is
pretty ugly.

Package:

I have chosen the 'f00f.net.irc.martyr' package.  

f00f - f00f networks.  Using the TLD is ugly, so I don't.
net - network-related projects
irc - irc-related projects
martyr - the martyr project.
